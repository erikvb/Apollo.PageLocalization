Redistributing the localization api

If you are a developer of menu solutions for DotNetNuke 3.x / 4.x (including any kind of 
module or skinobject that is capable of displaying page/tab names, titles and more), 
you hereby have been granted the right to use the Apollo Localization api in your own 
project(s). 

If you distribute your solution without source code, you are allowed to redistribute the
compiled assembly of the api (this is one file: Apollo.LocalizationApi.dll). You are NOT
allowed to make ANY changes to the api itself, so as to ensure that other modules, that
might use the api as well, will keep working.

If you distribute your solotion with source code, you are required to also redistribute
the source of this api, and include all documentation (licence, help file, release notes, 
this document).
